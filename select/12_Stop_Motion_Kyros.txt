You, you're crashing across the windshield
Oh you, you, you're piercing glass
You, you, you, you're feeling like the end is in sight
You're over now

See the pieces fall
See the skin resolve
See the flash of light
See the sun inside
See the fire and burn
See the smoulders gain
You're flying now

Like you always wanted
To feel how it feels, to feel
To feel, to feel
